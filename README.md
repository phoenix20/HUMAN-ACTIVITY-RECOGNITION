# HUMAN-ACTIVITY-RECOGNITION
Use Smartphone Data to predict one of the six human activities namely Standing,Laying,Sitting,Walking,Walking Upstairs and Walking Downstairs using various Prediction Models.

This Project is built using the shiny library of R.

Mainly two files -
1. UI.R
2. SERVER.R

The Data set can be downloaded from the uci machine learning repository for which the link is - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions

Initially the project takes about 20-30 minutes to run because the computations are quite exhaustive but after the first run we have saved the final results and the models into rds files which will be savd in the working directory.Doing this considerably reduces the running time to about 30 seconds. :) 

I used a lot of sources from the internet to learn how to build it.A special thanks to UCI for providing this dataset and all the other people out there who have shared their work online.Please feel free to use my code.A reference would be very much appreciated.
